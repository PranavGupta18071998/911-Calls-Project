# 911-Calls-Project
Analyzing 911 calls data

For this project I will be analyzing some 911 call data from Kaggle. The data contains the following fields:

lat : String variable, Latitude
lng: String variable, Longitude
desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
zip: String variable, Zipcode
title: String variable, Title
timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
twp: String variable, Township
addr: String variable, Address
e: String variable, Dummy variable 

Harnessing the power of Seaborn and Matplotlib we are able to perform Exploratory Data Analysis that gives us key insights about the Data. 
The project answers some very interesting and valuable questions such as:

What are the most common 911 calls?
When do they happen in terms of day of the week?
What hour of the day is most probable for a certain calls to happen?
Which month reported the highest number of 911 calls?

The project gave some really interesting insights by performing some EDA! Hope it is useful for people entering the field of Data Analysis.
