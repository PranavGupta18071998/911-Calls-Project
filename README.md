# 911-Calls-Project
Analyzing 911 calls data

For this project I will be analyzing some 911 call data from Kaggle. 
Harnessing the power of Seaborn and Matplotlib I am able to perform Exploratory Data Analysis that gives key insights about the Data. 
The project answers some very interesting and valuable questions such as:

What are the most common 911 calls?
When do they happen in terms of day of the week?
What hour of the day is most probable for a certain calls to happen?
Which month reported the highest number of 911 calls?

The project gave some really interesting insights by performing some EDA! 
Hope it is useful for people entering the field of Data Analysis.
